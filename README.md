# I Ching in Python

## Project Overview

This is a fork of Carlos del RÃ­o's IChingPython project that intends to expand the original  to include all 64 hexagrams of the I Ching.

I am working in english. So far, I have added the first 3 hexagrams. I need to add the remaining 61 hexagrams (4-64) while referencing Kari Hohne's I Ching resource at [Cafe au Soul](https://www.cafeausoul.com/iching/hexagrams/).
