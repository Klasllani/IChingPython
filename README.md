# I Ching in Python

## Project Overview

This is a fork of Carlos del RÃ­o's IChingPython project that intends to expand the original  to include all 64 hexagrams of the I Ching.

Writing in English, I added the first three hexagrams. I need to add the remaining 61 hexagrams (#4-64), using Kari Hohne's I Ching resource at [Cafe au Soul](https://www.cafeausoul.com/iching/hexagrams/) as a guide.
