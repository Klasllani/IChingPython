There are two files:
- The AllFunctions file contains three simple functions that complement each other and basically do all the work of throwing the coins and deciding if a line is going to be broken or not.
- The I.Ching file is the main program.

  **The I.Ching code is incomplete, the last part is missing and I will work on it**
